 /*\title Generation of PWM via GPT12
 * \abstract A pulse width modulated (PWM) signal with fixed frequency and a defined duty cycle is generated using GPT12.
 * \description The timer T3 of GPT1 is used in timer mode with its count direction configured to "down-counting".
 *              On underflow of timer T3, the Output Toggle Latch (T3OTL) is toggled and the value of timer T2
 *              or T4 is transferred into timer T3 depending on T3OTL value. The state of an LED is toggled in an
 *              interrupt service routine which is triggered by the timer T3.
