 /*\title MULTICAN data transmission
 * \abstract MULTICAN is used to exchange data between two nodes, implemented in the same device using Loop-Back mode.
 * \description A CAN message is sent from CAN node 0 to CAN node 1 using Loop-Back mode.
 *              After the CAN message transmission, an interrupt will be generated and LED1 will
 *              be turned on to confirm successful message transmission. Once the CAN message
 *              is successfully received by the CAN node 1, an interrupt will be generated.
 *              Inside the interrupt service routine the content of the received CAN message will be
 *              compared to the content of the transmitted CAN message. In case of a success, LED2
 *              will be turned on to confirm successful message reception.
